# 🤖 Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025 – Task 2

This repository contains my submission for **Task 2** of the **Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025**, focused on **predictive modeling** using the **Geldium dataset**. This task builds on insights from Task 1 (EDA) and applies GenAI-powered methods to design a responsible and explainable credit risk model.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

To create a structured predictive modeling plan that helps identify customers at risk of **delinquency**, using AI/ML approaches supported by GenAI tools.

Key objectives included:

- ✅ Developing model logic for binary classification (delinquent or not)
- ✅ Selecting and justifying the appropriate model (Logistic Regression)
- ✅ Planning for model evaluation using industry-standard metrics
- ✅ Addressing ethical considerations: bias, fairness, and explainability

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Platform Used

- **GenAI tools** like ChatGPT & Gemini (for logic generation and refinement)
- **Prompt-driven modeling approach**
- **Microsoft Word** – final plan drafted and formatted for submission
- Dataset provided via **GNI platform**

## 🧠 GenAI Prompt Used

> "You are a data analyst working in the financial domain. Based on a customer dataset that includes features such as income, age, missed payments, credit utilization, debt-to-income ratio, and account tenure, develop a complete predictive modeling plan to identify customers at risk of becoming delinquent.  
>  
> Use logistic regression as the modeling technique and outline the full pipeline, including:
> - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, and scaling)  
> - Feature engineering (e.g., aggregate missed payments)  
> - Model training and prediction logic  
> - Justification for model choice (accuracy, explainability, regulatory fit)  
> - Evaluation strategy using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC  
> - Bias detection, fairness checks, and mitigation techniques  
> - Ethical considerations such as transparency, human oversight, and impact on customers  
>  
> Generate the output in formal business language suitable for submission to financial stakeholders."
