## üîç GenAI Prompt Used for This Submission

As part of the Geldium Internship Task 2, the following GenAI prompt was used to generate a structured predictive modeling plan for customer delinquency risk assessment:

---

"You are a data analyst working in the financial domain. Based on a customer dataset that includes features such as income, age, missed payments, credit utilization, debt-to-income ratio, and account tenure, develop a complete predictive modeling plan to identify customers at risk of becoming delinquent.

Use logistic regression as the modeling technique and outline the full pipeline, including:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, and scaling)
- Feature engineering (e.g., aggregate missed payments)
- Model training and prediction logic
- Justification for model choice (accuracy, explainability, regulatory fit)
- Evaluation strategy using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC
- Bias detection, fairness checks, and mitigation techniques
- Ethical considerations such as transparency, human oversight, and impact on customers

Generate the output in formal business language suitable for submission to financial stakeholders."
