## Geldium Internship Task 2 â€“ Predictive Modeling Plan

This document contains my predictive model plan for identifying customer delinquency, built using insights from EDA and GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini). The model logic, justification, and evaluation strategy are designed to ensure accuracy, fairness, and ethical use in financial services.

ðŸ§  **Prompt used to generate the model logic:**

"Based on a dataset containing customer features like income, credit utilization, payment history, and account tenure, outline a complete predictive model plan to classify delinquent accounts using logistic regression. Include pseudo-code, feature selection, justification, evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score, AUC), and fairness considerations. Write in formal language suitable for financial analysis."
